# AEM Labs Feature Highlights

## Navigate Extensions
[AEM Labs](https://experience.adobe.com/aem/extension-manager) provides a centralized listing of extensions, accessible when you select a specific program and environment. This listing gives a comprehensive view of all available extensions for your organization, complete with their statuses, such as `Published` or `Draft`.

## Enabling/Disabling Extensions
[AEM Labs](https://experience.adobe.com/aem/extension-manager) gives the ability to enable or disable extensions on a per-instance basis. This means you can easily turn extensions on or off for specific AEM instances, granting you the flexibility to adapt features as needed. The process is straightforward â€“ just toggle a switch in the extensions view.

## Access Experimental Features
[AEM Labs](https://experience.adobe.com/aem/extension-manager) opens the door for developers to access AEM innovations through 1st-party extensions crafted by Adobe. These extensions bear the distinct label `Developed by Adobe`.

This means you can confidently explore and experiment with the latest features and enhancements, ensuring you stay at the forefront of AEM's capabilities without compromising the core releases.

## Configuring Extension Parameters
[AEM Labs](https://experience.adobe.com/aem/extension-manager) simplifies the process of adjusting extension configurations, specifically web parameters, without the need for repetitive extension deployments. Here's how to configure extension parameters:

5. With your parameters configured, you can now access these values using the [UIX SDK](https://github.com/adobe/uix-sdk) within your extension.
   
This streamlined process allows you to fine-tune your extension settings without the hassle of repeated deployments, putting control and customization in your hands.

## Extension Preview and Sharing
[AEM Labs](https://experience.adobe.com/aem/extension-manager) provides a safe playground to preview extensions before enabling them for the entire environment and the ability to easily share these previews.

### Preview Extensions
To preview extensions without installing them, simply click the preview icon found in the `Action` column. This action will open the Content Fragment Console, allowing you to explore the extension within the selected environment.

This collaborative feature ensures that your team can collectively evaluate and experiment with extensions before making them fully operational.

## BYO (Bring Your Own) Extensions
With [AEM Labs](https://experience.adobe.com/aem/extension-manager), you can register your extensions into the system and start using them, regardless of where they were initially deployed. Here's how to bring your own extensions into [AEM Labs](https://experience.adobe.com/aem/extension-manager):

1. Open [AEM Labs home page](https://experience.adobe.com/aem/extension-manager). From there, click on the `Bring Your Own Extension` option.

An important note to keep in mind: Your extension can be hosted anywhere, as long as it utilizes the [UIX SDK Guest library](https://github.com/adobe/uix-sdk#usage---guests). 

This flexibility ensures that you can seamlessly incorporate your own extensions into the AEM environment, enhancing your experience with your unique tools and features.
