# UI Extensions Development Flow

The document helps you understand how to setup, implement and deploy your own [UI Extension](pages/dx-devex-acceleration/uix-docs/overview/) with [Adobe App Builder](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/overview/)

## 1. Get Access to App Builder

Requesting access is a simple two-step process:
1. Complete the [request form](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/trial/). As a result, you will retrieve your Organization ID and name.
![Complete the request form](get-access-1.png)

2. Login with your Adobe ID to [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console) and accept agreement.
![Accept agreement](get-access-2.png)

For more details, please refer to [How to Get Access](pages/dx-devex-acceleration/uix-docs/overview/requirements/) page.

## 2. Create a new project in Adobe Developer Console

> Adobe Developer Console gives you access to APIs, SDKs and developer tools to integrate, and extend Adobe products. 
In App Builder, you need access to Adobe I/O Runtime credentials used for deploying your application, 
and access to API credentials if you want to access Adobe APIs in your application.

1. Sign in to [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console) with your Adobe ID
![Sign in to Adobe Developer Console](create-project-1.png)

2. Choose your account

3. Choose your profile or organizzation
![Choose your profile](create-project-3.png)

3. Make sure you are in a proper organization (a switcher in the right top corner).
![Check organization](create-project-4.png)

4. Click "Create new project" -> "Project from template" 
![Create project from template](create-project-5.png)
and choose "App Builder"
![Choose "App Builder"](create-project-6.png)

5. Fill the project data
![Fill the project data](create-project-7.png)
- `Project Title` is used to identify your project within [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console) and in [CLI](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli).
- `App Name` will be used as a unique identifier for your application and this value cannot be changed after project creating.

After creating, you should see a new project generated with 2 default Workspaces.
Each App Builder project has two default workspaces: `Production` and `Stage`. You can add more workspaces as needed. 
The `Production` workspace is special, as it is used for the submission and distribution flow.

## 3. Initialize our Application using the CLI for local development

Once your project is set up in [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console), we need to initialize our app in a local environment.
There are several ways how to do it. We will follow [Initializing your project with Extension Points](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/getting_started/first_app/#411-initializing-your-project-with-extension-points) option.
If necessary, you can find other options in [Bootstrapping new App using the CLI](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/getting_started/first_app/#4-bootstrapping-new-app-using-the-cli).

Firstly, you need to [Signing in from CLI](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/getting_started/first_app/#3-signing-in-from-cli):
1. In your Terminal type the following command:`aio login`.
A browser window and prompt should open, asking you to sign in with your Adobe ID. If the window does not automatically open,
you can also copy/paste the URL printed in your browser to log in. 
![aio login](initialize-application-1.png)
2. After logging in, you can close the browser window and return to the Terminal. You will see your user token printed in the Terminal. 
It is automatically stored in the [CLI](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli) configuration, which allows the [CLI](https://github.com/adobe/aio-cli) to use the token to interact with the [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console).

After that, you can [bootstrap your project](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/getting_started/first_app/#4-bootstrapping-new-app-using-the-cli):
1. Create a new project folder on your local machine and navigate to it in the Terminal.
2. Type `aio app init <app_name>`, where *<app_name>* is a name of your app in [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console). You will be prompted with a few questions about your `Organization`, `Project` and bootstrapping configuration.
3. Choose your `Organization` and `Project` (if you have a lot of projects, you can also start typing to shorten the list).
![Choose Project](initialize-application-3.png)
4. Select which extension point(s) do you with to implement.

<InlineAlert variant="warning" slots="text" />

Currently `cf-console-admin` extension point is not available in `Production`. You need to choose `DX Experience Cloud SPA v1`.

Once you complete, you should see the build process with necessary npm dependencies are getting installed.
![App initialization finished](initialize-application-4.png)

Also, [base project structure](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/getting_started/first_app/#5-anatomy-of-an-app-builder-application) will be generated.

## 4. Implement logic of Application 

At this step, we need to create a source code of App Builder Application which will implement existing [AEM UI Extension Points](pages/dx-devex-acceleration/uix-docs/services/aem-cf-console-admin/api/).
A general approach is described in [Introduction to Extensions](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/guides/extensions/).

The process of creating an application is described in [Step-by-step Extension Development](pages/dx-devex-acceleration/uix-docs/services/aem-cf-console-admin/guides/hello-world/) guide.
![Example of a project structure](implement-application-1.png)

## 5. Test and Deploy on Stage
Once the application is finished, it can be fully deployed to your development workspace (in our case to `Stage`) for testing. 

This command makes building and deploying of declared actions and frontend files/assets:
```console
aio app deploy
```

![aio app deploy](deploy-on-stage-1.png)

Now your application is reachable by URL, printed in Terminal.
You can use this URL for end-to-end testing.

To learn more about deployment, please refer to [Deploying the Application](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/getting_started/first_app/#7-deploying-the-application) 
and [Deployment Overview](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/guides/deployment/).

## 6. Deploy on Production
After deploying to `Stage` workgroup and testing, we are ready to deploy our application to `Production`.

The process is the same as for deploying to `Stage`, but first you need to switch the workgroup to `Production`.
Please type command `aio app use -w Production` in our project folder.

![Publishing](deploy-on-prod-1.png)

After workgroup switching, we can make building and deploying with `aio app deploy` command.

![Publishing](deploy-on-prod-2.png)

## 7. Publish the Application
When youâ€™re ready to publish your app, you will submit it for an approval from the Production workspace.
![Publishing](publishing-1.png)

After the approval, your app will be available at [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com/).

Also, data about your extension will be added to *Adobe App Registry* and will be reachable for Adobe Products.

This means, that the new functionality will be available, for example, in the AEM admin panel for your organization.
