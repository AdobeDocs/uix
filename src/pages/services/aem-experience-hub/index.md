# AEM Experience Hub

[Experience Hub](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/experience-hub/experience-hub) is your central starting point for working with Adobe Experience Manager. It brings together all the tools, environments, and resources you need in one place, making it easier to navigate, manage, and get work done faster. Instead of switching between multiple bookmarks, Experience Hub provides a single, streamlined entry point—helping you stay focused on creating, delivering, and optimizing experiences. 

UI Extensibility allows developers to enhance and customize the Experience Hub interface with modern front-end technology stack using JavaScript, Node.js, and React.

In this section, you will find the available [extension points](api) and examples of how to utilize them to create personalized experiences within Experience Hub.
