# UI Extensibility

UI Extensibility allows 3rd-party developers to customize and add their own logic to Adobe Experience Cloud services.

## Break the ice

UI extensions are JavaScript applications built with [Adobe App Builder](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/overview/) that can be embedded in UI Applications running under [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com/) unified shell. Adobe UI Services and UI Extensions implement a two-way communication protocol that enables the exchange of data, the invocation of actions, and the rendering of additional visual blocks.
